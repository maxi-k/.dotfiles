Improve the writing of only the paragraph that contains the current cursor — no other paragraphs. Identify the editable paragraph using the <cursor> context: the line or selection indicates which paragraph you may change. You may use surrounding paragraphs for context, but do not alter their text. Do not change the meaning of the paragraph you revise.
